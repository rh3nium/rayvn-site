# 🦅 Rayvn — Autonomous Hybrid Rescue Robotics Network

**Rayvn** is an IoT-driven autonomous rescue robotics system designed for disaster and crisis response.  
It combines **aerial drones and ground crawler bots** connected via a **LoRa-based mesh network**, enabling **offline, real-time victim detection, mapping, and communication** in GPS-denied environments.

> “Eyes in the sky, hope on the ground.”

## 🚨 Mission
Rayvn aims to bridge communication gaps during disasters by fusing **computer vision**, **thermal sensing**, and **AI-driven coordination** into a unified rescue network.  
Our system empowers responders with **live situational awareness**, even in areas with **no internet or unstable GPS**.

## 🧠 Core Features
- **Swarm Coordination** — Multi-agent task allocation and movement planning between aerial and ground units.  
- **Sensor Fusion** — Combines camera, thermal, and environmental (gas/smoke) data for robust detection.  
- **LoRa Mesh Network** — Offline, long-range communication between bots and base stations.  
- **AI-Assisted Detection** — YOLOv8 + OpenCV pipeline for human/victim recognition and hazard detection.
- **Autonomous Pathfinding** — Efficient, dynamic route generation for rescue and navigation with A*.
- **Rescue Dashboard** — Flask-based command panel showing live maps, mesh health, and victim coordinates.
